## Material Ocean is a theme for various Applications based on a blueish ocean color scheme

### Introduction:

> This is my own effort to create a color scheme that doesn't blind me by being too dark or too light and not solarized (ex favorite ).
>
> i found this color (`0f111a`) for the first time on material theme for vscode, so i copied the main color and added other colors gradually with time until here we are
>
> currently anything that uses xresources can use these colors, and there are many other apps themed as well.
